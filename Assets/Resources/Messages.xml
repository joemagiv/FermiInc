      <BodyString>Greetings Manager.
Planet ID 6462 continues to show little improvement with latest protocols. Very low life signs, resources are failing to develop.
I will notify you if things change but currently I am less than optimistic.

      <BodyString>Hey buddy,
Just wanted to follow up with our talk earlier today, I'm really hoping you can turn your planet around.
Would really hate to let you go but I can't be carrying around deadweight, maybe Les can give you some pointers.
Don't be afraid to ask for help from your betters! Keep that in mind!

	  <BodyString> Hey Les!
Things are going great down here! The dinosaurs are thriving and life is flourishing across the planet.
Not sure what magic you're working up there but it's showing great dividends. I have noticed a slight uptick in meteoric activity but the defense matrix is holding strong. 
Keep it up man!

	  <BodyString>Hey honey,
I know you've been working real hard lately, so I thought maybe we'd go out somewhere special tonight?
I guess that's not so much a question because I already booked us the Gray Room at Blorfo's!

A moderate uptick in activity today, not totally sure what from. Possibly just an issue with our instrumentation.
I'll keep an eye on it and report in if there's actually a positive trend.

	  <BodyString> Heyyy Les,
Soooo, bad news bud, seems like the Meteoric Defense Matrix got disabled and the planet got hit pretty bad. The dust kicked up from the impact has covered the planet in a layer of dust that basically killed everything.
Life scores way down, resources took a hit, the environment is mostly fine and should return to normal as long as temperatures hold steady above 13frz.

      <BodyString>Hey rockstar,
Heard about your bad luck with the asteroid, or was it a meteor? I can never keep those two straight.
I AM worried that this sort of event can sometimes kick start a civilization, make sure your verticals are still out of alignment and we shouldn't have any problem.
Anyways just wanted to say that everybody has an off day and I'm sure this won't reflect too poorly on your semi-quarterly review.

Nothing really exciting, numbers are similar to yesterday.

      <BodyString>Hey boss,
Things are getting worse, much worse. So the temperature dropped suddenly and there was a brief ice age.
The ice age cleared but here's the real bad news... I hope you're sitting down for this, the planet has got apes now. 
We're going to need to stabilize this before they start understanding tools, they're not ready for it. Be sure to cancel any and all seeding protocols.

Resource numbers are up, lifesigns continue to be stable. Saw we're starting to rise in the rankings,
I'm sure that's making you happy. I know I hated how we were on the bottom for so long. At this rate we could easily be on top before the end of the cycle.

      <BodyString>Greetings Mr. Izfizz,
	  I'm Jane Parzkek the specially assigned Civilization Specialist. I was assigned by your Planetary Supervisor to provide support.
Seems like you've really made a mess of this haven't you Mr. Izfizz? Well I'm going to initiate an immediate freeze off.
This should kill the humanoids and reduce the resource score, but we can't afford to take any chances. Temperature must maintain below 10frz to ensure total burnoff.
